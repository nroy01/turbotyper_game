# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** August 2025

TurboTyper is designed to be privacy-first. We do **not** collect personal data, do not use analytics SDKs, and do not show ads.

## Data We Collect
We do **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data. Your typing runs, stats, and local leaderboard entries are stored **only on your device** (via iOS storage).

## Third-Party Services
TurboTyper uses only Apple system frameworks. If you sign in to **Game Center**, Apple may process data to provide Game Center features. That data is handled by Apple under their policies, not by us.

## Children’s Privacy
TurboTyper is rated 4+. We do not collect personal data from anyone, including children.

## Data Requests
Because we do not collect personal data or run a backend, there is nothing for us to access, delete, or export. To reset app data, you can reinstall the app which clears local storage.

## Changes
If this policy changes, we’ll update this page and the “Effective date”.
